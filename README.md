 Using NN to recognize handwritten digits

Simple explanation about
batch size:

The amount of data included in each sub-epoch weight
change is known as the batch size. For example, with a
training dataset of 1000 samples, a full batch size would be
1000, a mini-batch size would be 500 or 200 or 100, and an
online batch size would be just 1
